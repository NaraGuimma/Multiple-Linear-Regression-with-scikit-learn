# Multiple Linear Regression with scikit-learn


This project is a hands-on lab at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scikit-learn-multiple-linear-regression/home/welcome) using scikit-learn for a multiple linear regression problem. 


The learning objextives were:

* Build univariate and multivariate linear regression models using scikit-learn
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization with seaborn
* Evaluate model fit and accuracy using numerical measures such as RÂ² and RMSE
* Model interaction effects in regression using basic feature engineering techniques
